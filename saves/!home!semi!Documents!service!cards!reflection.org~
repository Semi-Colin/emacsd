#+TITLE:Reflection

I chose the opportunity to participate in the Any Refugee card writing service, because I find the issue of people around the world seeking refuge a heart-breaking and awful problem that needs to be addressed. Though I am not able to directly help with solving this issue, I felt compelled to do my part in attempting to comfort and support those who lack a permanent home. From personal experience, simple, kind words have done wonders to improving my attitude and making me feel better, so I felt obligated to share this principle with those who need the support more than I do.
