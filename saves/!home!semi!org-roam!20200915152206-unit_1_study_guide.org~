** Forces
*** Net force
The total absolute force that is being applied to an object.

- 20 newtons of force applied downwards and 20 newtons applied upwards will result in a net force of 0.
- 50 newtons of force applied to the left, and 25 newtons right will result in a net force of 25.

Since it is the absolute value, directions don't matter aside from whether they are pairs or not. 
*** Types of forces
**** Gravity
The force that is created by a very large object (i.e a planet) which pulls an object towards its surface.
**** Normal/Support
A resting object that does not exert any more force than that to oppose gravity. The name explains it well enough.
***** Examples
+ Table
+ Ground
**** Applied
A force that is being actively exerted to push or pull an object.
***** Examples
+ Pushing hand
+ Hammer
**** Friction
The result of two objects rubbing together as they move. This causes the moving object(s) to slow down slightly. 
**** Air Resistance
The result of the air pushing back against a moving object. Usually has a negligible effect except for very rapid objects.
**** Tension
The result of a rope, rod, string, etc. pulling an object. 
*** Free Body Diagrams
A type of diagram that represents all forces being applied to an object as arrows labeled by the type of force. 
*** Equilibrium
**** Static equilibrium
A state in which almost no force is being exerted on an object, rendering the net force zero.
**** Dynamic equilibrium
A state in which forces applied cancel out, rendering the net force zero.
** Weight
*** Standard SI Unit
Newtons
** Mass
*** Standard SI Unit
Kilogram
** Relationships of Weight, Mass, and Gravity
*** Weight = Mass * Gravity
*** Mass = Weight / Gravity
*** Gravity = Weight / Mass
** GUESS
*** Givens
The information that is told through the problem. Ideas that are easily inferred, such as that 'on Earth' means that gravity is 10m/s², are also included.
*** Unknowns 
The information that is not given, usually things that you need to find to solve the problem.
*** Equation
The equation that results in finding the unknown.

Unknown = [Expression involving givens]
*** Substitute
Replace placeholder items with their actual values.
*** Solve
Solve the problem algebraically.
** System Internationale
*** Acronym
The acronym for System Internationale is SI.
*** Translation
It means "International System"
*** Metric System
**** Prefixes
The metric system uses the same set of prefixes for every unit. These modify the magnitude of the unit. Kilo means thousand, so a kilogram is 1,000 grams. Centi means hundredth, so 100 centimeters is 1 meter. 
***** Converting between prefixes
To convert, between prefixes, you can move the decimal point. For every x10 it increases, move the decimal right. For every ÷10 it decreases, move the decimal point left. 
** Scatter Plots
*** Independent variable
The independent variable is the variable that influences the dependent variable. You change the independent to see how the dependent is changed.
**** What axis it belongs to
The X axis, always.
*** Dependent variable
The variable that is changed by the independent. 
**** What axis it belongs to
The Y axis, always.
*** Chart title
Lists the independent and dependent variables
*** Axis titles
The axes should be labeled with the variable name and its unit. 
*** Trendline
**** Negative association
When the trendline decreases throughout the x axis
**** Positive association
When the trendline increases throughout the x axis.
**** Equation
The slope-intercept equation of the trendline.
**** R²
How accurate the trendline is. The closer it is to 1, the better it is.
*** Caption
Describes whether there is a negative or positive association, and other useful details to include.
