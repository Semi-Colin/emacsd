#+title: Like for X, Retweet for Y

This is where one makes a post on a platform such as Youtube or Twitter that acts as a pseudo-poll. This follows the format "like for x, retweet/reply for y".

This is an obvious data manipulation tool, as in an average post, a like is much more common than a retweet or a reply. Many people like posts thoughtlessly, and making a reply is a much more deliberate action. In addition, this shuts down discussion, as people will be 'voting' by their communication with others, another psychological manipulation. Furthermore, it involves a herd mentality, where people will see this disjoint between the likes and the replies, and will decide to follow suit, increasing the gap even further. 

Finally, the most obvious issue with this type of post is that their post gains traction no matter if you agree with them or not. It will boost their online following
