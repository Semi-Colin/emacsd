* Journey of Faith
Abram scared that King of Egypt will like his wife, and kill him so that the king can take her. Abram tells his wife to call herself his sister, but the king then takes her anyway, as he thinks that Abram is only her brother. Because of this, many disasters occurred to Egypt. Abram is not perfect.

His wife is unable to bear a child, and so requests that Abram has intercourse with her handmaid so that her child is theirs.
* Covenants

** The world behind the text
Sacrifices were done to please the Gods so they could have good crops and good fortune. Some sacrificed children because of that, and some sacrificed children because life was hard, and they wanted the children to be with God as soon as possible.
** The test of Abraham
Will you sacrifice Isaac and pass the test?
** Call and Response
"Abraham!"
"Here I am!" he replied.

The call and the response are directly next to each other, there are no saying words in between. Abraham responds to God immediately.
** Layering of Isaac

Only Son....................
Only Son Isaac..............
Only Son Isaac Whom You Love

Ishmael is dead to the covenant.
** The third day
Abraham is confident in his decision and is continuing to do what he is resolved to do.
*** The Missing Word
"We will worship and then come back."

The word "we" is implied in the second clause, but it is never said. 
*** Abraham's protective love
When traveling, Abraham carries the knife and the fire, both tools that could hurt him, and Isaac only carrys the wood, which could not hurt him.
